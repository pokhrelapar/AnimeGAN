# AnimeGAN

Have you wondered how your nearest caf√© or the streets would look like if it were in an anime? How would you like as an anime character? Relieve that experience using AnimeGAN.

This is my Computer Vision final project that discusses the widely acclaimed General Adversarial Network (GAN) : AnimeGAN that uses machine learning through neural style transfer and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve a real "anime-like" conversion of an image.
